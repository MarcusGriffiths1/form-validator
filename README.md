# Simple Form Validation

## Installation

To install: `cd project/directory` then `npm install`, that's it!

Change all the names etc in `package.json` and `bower.json`

###Folders and files:
#####src/sass
Create and make changes to `.scss` files. Compiles just like SASS usually would, looks for a file named `main.scss`

#####src/js
Create and make changes to `.js` files

#####src/css
Add `.css` files such as frameworks etc here, do not change styles.css as this will be overwritten by the SASS compiler

#####dist
Files in `js` and `css` should be left alone, these will compile
